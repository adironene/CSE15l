# Lab Report 2

When writing programs, it is common to encounter bugs. In fact, most projects require an average debug time of 50% - 75%. This report demonstrates some of the bugs found in the Markdown-parser and the steps our team took to fix the issues.

### Debugging Terminology

| Name | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
|**Symptom**|A faulty program behavior that you can see|
|**Bug**|A flaw in a computer system that may have zero or more symptoms|
|**Latent Bug**|An asymptomatic bug; it will show itself at an inconvenient time| 
|**Debugging**| using symptoms and other information to find a bug| 
|**Failure-inducing input**| input to the program that causes the bug to execute and symptoms to appear|
|**Deterministic platform**| A platform having the property that it can reliably reproduce a bug from its failure-inducing input|

> **Note** - I created a new file to demonstrate the changes for cleaner code. The old version had a few random print statements inserted in multiple places. If interested, the original Repo can be found [Here](https://github.com/adironene/markdown-parser).
