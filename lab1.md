The Secure Shell Protocal, also known as SSH, allows two computers to securely communicate over an unsecured network. This blog post is a documentation of the steps required to set up and use remote access. 

## Installing VS Code   

We will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our main IDE for this course. 

**Please follow these steps to set up VS Code**
- Head over to [VS Code Install Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Press the `Download` Button
- Select `Window`, `Linx`, or `MacOS`
- Finish the download process and open VS Code

When the procedure is done, your IDE should look something similar to the image below.

| ![image](images/search.png) | Search | You may enter a `keyword` and VS Code will find the files containing that string.
| ![image](images/source.png)| Source Control | The class that handles the changes made to the directory.
| ![image](images/debug.png) | Run and Debug | This function allows you to debug the errors in your code.
